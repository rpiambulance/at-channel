# at-channel
**at-channel** is a Slack integration that allows admins to turn _off_ their @channel permissions in a Slack workspace, while allowing a team of admins and moderators to approve or reject requests from any member.

Setup and configuration will be added to this README when we recover from a 20-hour coding session.
